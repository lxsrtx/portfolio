            <p>The goal of this project is to improve their design strategy and identity of the brand to help them expand their sale

        <div class="project-overview">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Cocoon is a brand that focuses on blankets.  Cocoon’s design style is a harmonious blend of modern sophistication and 
                natural warmth. The brand aims to create an inviting atmosphere that resonates with comfort and coziness. It’s 
                fairly new to the market by being a year old brand. Their struggle is making sales and attracting clients, which 
                makes their brand strategy ineffective.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Based on the strategy that was set previously, I redesigned the old logo and established new colour palette with more 
            vibrant colours and typography that conveys bubbly, friendly feeling, since their target audience is focused on people 
            from 14 to 30 years old with fun and outgoing personality. Brand guidelines were created with their new brand strategy 
            that will help with staying cohesive and worked on 2D packaging sleeve design with different colour variation for 
            different type of blankets. The new brand identity will be the main selling point for Cocoon since it better targets 
            their audience. Overall, I enjoyed working on this project, since it meant for me to get out of my comfort zone and 
            try different design style.</p>
