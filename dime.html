                and their professionalism. It didn’t have any brand identity initial, since Dime entered the market 3 month ago 
                and was in need of a website.</p>

        <p>I’ve created a new logo in minimalistic style that showcases building outline with their brand name 
            at bottom as well as brand guideline that will help the brand stay cohesive in the future across all 
            platforms. After establishing their brand identity, it was time to design their website layout that 
            will also follow the minimalistic, clean creative direction with interesting grid and use of white 
            space. The UI/UX of the website  is simple yet effective that captures their target audience’s attention 
            perfectly and attract them even more.</p>
