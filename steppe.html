        <p>I think the Vogue magazine project turned out really well. I focused on keeping everything connected
            across the 40 pages. By using repeated elements, like those solid rectangles, I made sure the design
            flowed smoothly. I chose a golden yellow color that wasn't too flashy but added a classy touch,
            keeping things calm and elegant. Using mostly one color made the different colors used for features
            stand out and kept things interesting. The layout, with lots of white space and some breaks from the
            usual order, helped keep readers engaged. Overall, the Vogue project is a cohesive and visually
            appealing piece that I'm proud of.</p>
